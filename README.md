# Arabic-Handwritten-Recognition-UX-Design-Research-Data-Analysis

In this notebook I use the data collected from google forms to perform data ana;ysis and answer important questions for the stakeholders.
This is done as part of UX Nanodegree reserach project.

## Executive Summaty
This research explores participants’ challenges, satisfaction levels, and market potential for Arabic handwritten recognition tools. Demand is strong, especially among monthly and weekly users, but key pain points include poor recognition accuracy and limited support for various handwriting styles. Satisfaction is low, with over half of respondents dissatisfied, and users consistently request improved accuracy, editable text, and multi-format export options. Privacy concerns, though less common, affect payment preferences. Despite price sensitivity, market potential is promising, most participants are open to mobile apps, favoring free versions with ads.
The research highlights opportunities to improve the technology and align monetization with user needs.
